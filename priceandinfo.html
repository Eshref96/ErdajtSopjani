            <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">In terms of chassis dynamics, the E60 M5 is still great to drive, even if it was the start of BMW getting a bit too high-tech</p>

            
            
        
             <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">for its own good. However, that brilliant engine, along with much of its fancy tech, likes to take a dump on owners, which costs several thousands of dollars to remedy</p>
         
            
             <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">It’s been more than a decade since the E60 M5 came out and I think time has certainly been kind to its styling. By comparison, some current BMWs look fussy and overstyled - this model M5 has a totally unique look to it and, while some may still not see it as beautiful, its pleasant overall proportions will draw attention away from the more controversial front and rear fascias.
            </p>

            <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"> It was fine at launch, when the car was new, providing a one of a kind soundtrack, near-9,000 rpm redline, and plenty of shove, but over the years it’s proven quite unreliable in certain areas.

                There’s nothing wrong with the lump itself, but the odd oil cooler, sensor, or pump can wear out, stop working properly, then cause other linked systems to malfunction. Next thing you know, the car’s instrument cluster looks more like a Christmas tree. Obviously, if the car is serviced religiously and all replacement parts are either original or an improved aftermarket solution, then the V-10 will run fine and provide its owner with many glorious miles of motoring.
